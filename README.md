# Football-Player-Management System,
aims at tracing  a footbal player from a young age. It allows coaches to trace player perfomance, medical codition, awards won, area of weakiness etc.
I developed this system to help coaches choose the best player for a post during tornaments.
Players status can be apdated any time as long as there is improvement.
The system only allows admins to make edits, register a player. The doctor can only edit and view medical reports of a player.
